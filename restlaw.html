<h3>Restaurant Liquor Laws</h3>
<ul>
	<li><h4><cite>A.R.S. §4-205.02.</cite>  Restaurant license; issuance; regulatory provisions; expiration; definitions</h4></li>
	<p>A. The director may issue a restaurant license to any restaurant in this state THAT is regularly open for the serving of food to guests for compensation and THAT has suitable kitchen facilities connected with the restaurant for keeping, cooking and preparing foods required for ordinary meals.</p>
	<p>B. The director shall issue the license in the name of the restaurant upon application for the license by the owner or lessee of the restaurant, provided the applicant is otherwise qualified to hold a spirituous liquor license.  The holder of such license is subject to the penalties prescribed for any violation of the law relating to alcoholic beverages.</p>
	<p>C. The holder of a restaurant license may sell and serve spirituous liquors solely for consumption on the licensed premises.  For the purpose of this subsection, "licensed premises" may include rooms, areas or locations in which the restaurant normally sells or serves spirituous liquors pursuant to regular operating procedures and practices and that are contiguous to the restaurant or a noncontiguous patio pursuant to section 4-101, paragraph 26.  For the purposes of this subsection, a restaurant licensee must submit proof of tenancy or permission from the landowner or lessor for all property to be included in the licensed premises.</p>
	<p>D. In addition to other grounds prescribed in this title upon which a license may be revoked, the director may require the holder OF a restaurant license issued pursuant to this section to surrender the license in any case in which the licensee ceases to operate as a restaurant, as prescribed in subsection A of this section.  The surrender of a license pursuant to this subsection does not prevent the director from revoking the license for other grounds prescribed in this title or for making deliberate material misrepresentations to the department regarding the licensee's equipment, service or entertainment items or seating capacity in applying for the restaurant license.</p>
	<p>E. Neither the Director nor the board may initially issue a restaurant license if either finds that there is sufficient evidence that the operation will not satisfy the criteria adopted by the director for issuing a restaurant licensed described in section 4-209, subsection B, paragraph 12.  The director shall issue a restaurant license only if the applicant has submitted a plan for the operation of the restaurant.  The plan shall be completed on forms provided by the department and shall include listings of all restaurant equipment and service items, the restaurant seating capacity and other information requested by the department to substantiate that the restaurant will operate in compliance with this section.</p>
	<p>F. The holder of the license described in section 4-209, subsection B, paragraph 12 who intends to alter the seating capacity or dimensions of a restaurant facility shall notify the department in advance on forms provided by the department.</p>
	<p>G. For the PURPOSES of this section:</p>
	<p>1. “Gross revenue” means the revenue derived from all sales of food and spirituous liquor on the licensed premises, regardless of whether the sales of spirituous liquor are made under a restaurant license issued pursuant to this section or under any other license that has been issued for the premises pursuant to this article.</p>
	<p>“Restaurant" means an establishment which derives at least forty per cent of its gross revenue from the sale of food, including sales of food for consumption off the licensed premises if the amount of these sales included in the calculation of gross revenue from the sale of food does not exceed fifteen percent of all gross revenue of the restaurant.</p>
	<li><h4><cite>A.R.S. §4-213.</cite> Restaurant audit</h4></li>
	<p>A. 	The director may require a restaurant to submit an audit of its records to demonstrate compliance with section 4-205.02. The director shall not require an establishment to submit to such an audit more than once a year after the initial twelve months of operation even if the establishment is allowed to continue operating as a restaurant pursuant to subsection E of this section.</p>
	<p>B. 	Except as provided in subsection D of this section, the department shall audit accounts, records and operations of a licensee that cover a twelve month period. When conducting an audit, the department shall use generally accepted auditing standards. An establishment that averages at least forty per cent of its gross revenue from the sale of food during the twelve month audit period shall be deemed to comply with the gross revenue requirements of section 4-205.02. The twelve month audit period shall fall within the sixteen months immediately preceding the beginning of the audit.</p>
	<p>C.   If the audit or a consent agreement that may be offered at the discretion of the director and that is signed by the licensee and the director reveals that the licensee did not meet the definition of a restaurant as prescribed in section 4-205.02 and the percentage of food sales determined by the audit or consent agreement was:</p>
	<p>1. Less than thirty per cent, notwithstanding section 4-209, subsection A, the director shall deem the license to have been surrendered or may revoke the license as provided in section 4-205.02, subsection D.</p>
	<p>2. At least thirty per cent but less than thirty-seven per cent, the department shall allow the licensee a six month period to continue to operate under the restaurant license, during which the licensee shall either:</p>
	<p>(a) Replace the license with a bar or beer and wine bar license, except that, at the end of that six	 month period, the department shall revoke the restaurant license or the licensee shall surrender the restaurant license.</p>
	<p>(b) Obtain permission from the department to continue operating with a restaurant license pursuant to subsection E of this section.</p>
	<p>3. At least thirty-seven per cent but less than forty per cent, the licensee shall be granted a period of one year to continue to operate under the restaurant license, during which the licensee shall attempt to increase the food percentage to at least forty per cent. If the licensee does not increase the percentage of food sales to at least forty per cent, the department shall allow the licensee a six month period to continue to operate under the restaurant license, during which the licensee shall either:</p>
	<p>(a) Replace the license with a bar or beer and wine bar license, except that, at the end of the six month period, the department shall revoke the restaurant license or the licensee shall surrender the restaurant license.
(	<p>b) Obtain permission from the department to continue operating with a restaurant license pursuant to subsection E of this section.</p>
	<p>D.   The department may conduct an audit of a licensee described in section 4-209, subsection B, paragraph 12 after twelve months following the beginning of operations as a restaurant by the licensee to determine compliance by the licensee with section 4-205.02, except that the department may conduct an audit of a licensee within the first twelve months of operation if the licensee has made a substantial modification in the restaurant equipment, service or entertainment items or seating capacity during that twelve month period, in which event the department may conduct the audit for a period of less than twelve months.</p>
	<p>E.   A restaurant licensee may continue to operate with its restaurant license if its food sales are at least thirty per cent and less than forty per cent and the department approves the continuation of the restaurant license pursuant to this subsection and subsections C, F, G, H and I of this section. The department shall not approve more than fifteen restaurant licenses pursuant to this subsection and subsections C, F, G, H and I of this section any fiscal year. The department shall not approve any additional licenses pursuant to this subsection and subsections C, F, G, H and I of this section from consent agreements entered into or audits conducted in any fiscal year after 2012-2013. The department may approve a request submitted by the licensee to continue to operate with its restaurant license only if all of the following apply at the time the licensee files its request with the department:</p>
	<p>1. The restaurant has a sufficient number of cooks, food preparation personnel and wait staff to prepare and provide the restaurant services that are necessary for the menu offered by the licensee.</p>
	<p>2. The restaurant's equipment is of a sufficient grade and the size of the restaurant's kitchen is appropriate to the menu offered and the kitchen occupies not less than twenty per cent of the total floor space of the licensed premises.</p>
	<p>3. The menu is of a type consistent with a restaurant operation. In making a determination pursuant to this paragraph, the department may consider the proportion of food sales to alcohol sales, the price of spirituous liquor beverages and food served by the licensee and whether the licensee provides reduced price or complimentary food and beverages.</p>
	<p>4. Not more than thirty per cent of the public interior area floor space consists of pool tables, dart or arcade games, barstools, cocktail tables and similar types of seating and dance floors, and the aggregate area of all dance floors on the premises is not greater than ten per cent of the total floor space of the public area of the premises.</p>
	<p>5. The name of the restaurant does not include terms associated with alcohol consumption, such as "bar", "tavern", "pub", "spirits", "club", "lounge", "cabaret", "cantina" or "saloon".</p>
	<p>6. Disposable dinnerware and smallware, including dining utensils, are not used except in outdoor areas.</p>
	<p>F.   If the department intends to approve a restaurant's continuation of operation pursuant to subsection E of this section:</p>

<h3>Hotel/Motel With Restaruant Liquor Laws</h3>
	<li><h4><cite>A.R.S. §4-205.02.</cite>  Restaurant license; issuance; regulatory provisions; expiration; definitions</h4></li>
	<p>A. The director may issue a restaurant license to any restaurant in this state THAT is regularly open for the serving of food to guests for compensation and THAT has suitable kitchen facilities connected with the restaurant for keeping, cooking and preparing foods required for ordinary meals.</p>
	<p>B. The director shall issue the license in the name of the restaurant upon application for the license by the owner or lessee of the restaurant, provided the applicant is otherwise qualified to hold a spirituous liquor license.  The holder of such license is subject to the penalties prescribed for any violation of the law relating to alcoholic beverages.</p>
	<p>C. The holder of a restaurant license may sell and serve spirituous liquors solely for consumption on the licensed premises.  For the purpose of this subsection, "licensed premises" may include rooms, areas or locations in which the restaurant normally sells or serves spirituous liquors pursuant to regular operating procedures and practices and that are contiguous to the restaurant or a noncontiguous patio pursuant to section 4-101, paragraph 26.  For the purposes of this subsection, a restaurant licensee must submit proof of tenancy or permission from the landowner or lessor for all property to be included in the licensed premises.</p>
	<p>D. In addition to other grounds prescribed in this title upon which a license may be revoked, the director may require the holder OF a restaurant license issued pursuant to this section to surrender the license in any case in which the licensee ceases to operate as a restaurant, as prescribed in subsection A of this section.  The surrender of a license pursuant to this subsection does not prevent the director from revoking the license for other grounds prescribed in this title or for making deliberate material misrepresentations to the department regarding the licensee's equipment, service or entertainment items or seating capacity in applying for the restaurant license.</p>
	<p>E. Neither the Director nor the board may initially issue a restaurant license if either finds that there is sufficient evidence that the operation will not satisfy the criteria adopted by the director for issuing a restaurant licensed described in section 4-209, subsection B, paragraph 12.  The director shall issue a restaurant license only if the applicant has submitted a plan for the operation of the restaurant.  The plan shall be completed on forms provided by the department and shall include listings of all restaurant equipment and service items, the restaurant seating capacity and other information requested by the department to substantiate that the restaurant will operate in compliance with this section.</p>
	<p>F. The holder of the license described in section 4-209, subsection B, paragraph 12 who intends to alter the seating capacity or dimensions of a restaurant facility shall notify the department in advance on forms provided by the department.</p>
	<p>G. For the PURPOSES of this section:</p>
	<p>1. “Gross revenue” means the revenue derived from all sales of food and spirituous liquor on the licensed premises, regardless of whether the sales of spirituous liquor are made under a restaurant license issued pursuant to this section or under any other license that has been issued for the premises pursuant to this article.</p>
	<p>“Restaurant" means an establishment which derives at least forty per cent of its gross revenue from the sale of food, including sales of food for consumption off the licensed premises if the amount of these sales included in the calculation of gross revenue from the sale of food does not exceed fifteen percent of all gross revenue of the restaurant.</p>
	<li><h4><cite>R19 1 208.</cite>	Hotel/Motel/Restaurant Requirements</h4></li>
	<p>A Hotel/Motel licensee and a Restaurant licensee must maintain complete restaurant services as defined under <cite>A.R.S. § 4-205.01</cite>, and <cite>A.R.S. § 4-205.02</cite>, continually during the hours of selling and serving spirituous liquors. Restaurant services, as defined under these stat¬utes, is compulsory to 10 p.m. daily if any spirituous liquors are to be sold and served to the legal hours. A requested meal which is refused during these hours will constitute sufficient evidence that the licensed business has ceased to operate as a bona fide restaurant.</p>
